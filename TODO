Still needing to be done:

• Make a comprehensive test suite of valid and invalid assembly programs
• Make a corresponding set of expected outputs for the programs (when run by the emulator to come)
• Add remaining instructions to assembler
• Build the emulator (all missing. Subdivide tasks when starting)
• Make a program that automatically runs assembles all the files in valid and invalid folders and reports if the correct ones succeeded and failed.
• Add extra features like a stack after v1.0 is implemented both in assembler and emulator. Introduce skeleton support in v1.0 only.
• Ongoing: Clean up code. Evaluate if things need to be moved to shared libraries/object files/headers.
