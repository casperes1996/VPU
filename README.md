# VPU - The Virtual Processing Unit

The VPU is a simple, fixed-length instruction set architecture. In this repository I intend to document the instruction set, write an assembler for it and implement an emulator to run the generated machine code for the VPU.

This is a hobby project I'm doing just for fun and I have not thought it through in advance. I am just hacking things together as it comes along all for fun. Some fundamental design decisions early on may prove problematic later on; It doesn't matter. I'm doing this just to have fun for now. 

Perhaps with time I'll even write an OS for the VPU; But I have pretty limited time for hobby projects so this project may evolve incredibly slowly and potentially eventually not at all. If you like any of it, feel free to take it and do with it whatever you want.

For more specific information on any particular part of the VPU project see each subdirectory's README and documentaion files
